## General info

The better NUS facilities manager for all your workout needs.

## Screenshots

Coming soon!

## Features

A **Website** that contains a database for all the bookings in all NUS gym/swimming pool facilities. Beyond allowing students to book a slot, other features include a dashboard that displays current and previous gym traffic, importing timetables from NUSmods to filter out slots that clash with the studentâ€™s timetable and an account management system to manage previous bookings and cancellations.

The **Telegram Bot** provides an easy to use interface for students to make a booking for NUS gyms/pools. It will also allow for limited access to the dashboard without any filtering.

Given the ubiquity of Telegram amongst NUS Students, our objective is to port over as much of the functionality as possible from the web app.

1. Website

   - Real-time booking system
   - Dashboard that displays current and previous gym/pool traffic, aggregated by a date range that users can specify. Users can also filter by day of the week.
   - Import timetable from NUSmods to filter out clashing slots
   - View NUSMods timetable that includes both modules and booked slots
   - An account system for each user containing their previous bookings

2. Telegram Bot
   - Real-time booking system that is synced with the website
   - Dashboard that displays current and previous gym/pool traffic, aggregated by selected dates.
